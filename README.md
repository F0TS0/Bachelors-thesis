# Bachelors-thesis
This project focuses on the development of an AI-powered chatbot for FAQ management and website assistance as part of a bachelor’s thesis.

The goal of the project is to improve website user experience by providing a conversational interface capable of answering frequently asked questions, assisting users with basic website navigation, and redirecting users to a contact form when a query cannot be resolved automatically.

The application consists of a simple landing page that serves as a demonstration environment. The primary focus of the project is the chatbot itself, rather than extensive website functionality or visual complexity. The landing page exists mainly to support interaction with the chatbot and to present the project context.

The chatbot operates using a combination of static FAQ data and dynamically generated responses, allowing it to simulate intelligent behavior while maintaining structured and predictable outputs. This hybrid approach improves reliability and reduces the risk of incorrect responses compared to fully generative systems.

To keep the project cost-free, no paid AI services or commercial APIs are used. Instead, the project emphasizes chatbot architecture, dialogue flow design, data handling, and user experience principles, demonstrating how an AI-assisted FAQ system can be designed and evaluated within realistic technical and financial constraints.


AI Chatbot Project – Focus Steps
	1.	Setup & Architecture – Initialize project, connect OpenAI API, setup FAQ database.
	2.	Chat UI – Build responsive chat interface for web and mobile.
	3.	FAQ & AI Integration – Bot answers FAQ from database; GPT handles other questions.
	4.	Navigation & Contact – Bot guides users through site and suggests contact form if needed.
	5.	Admin Panel (Optional) – Simple interface to manage FAQ entries.
	6.	Testing & Polish – Test bot responses, fix bugs, improve UI.
	7.	Documentation & Presentation – Describe architecture, workflow, and development process.
